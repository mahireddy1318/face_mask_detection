# About
> In this project, I'm going to build a model to detect whether a person is wearing mask in real-time. 
  I will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library, CNN and Keras.


## Development setup

To run the code clone the repo and run..

```sh
python train.py
python test.py
```
